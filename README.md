### NIMBY Kernel
I am attempting to learn the NIM programming language and decided to write an
operating system to help me learn.

This repository contains the kernel code for the NIMBY Operating System.

This is all a work-in-progress, so far I have only finished out the
foundational work for the base config system and have some starting code for
handling multiboot.
